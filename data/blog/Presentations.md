Most scientific presentations are very good in that they tell a story. We are
trained and being told to tell a story about our work. The one thing is that no
one cares. One of the most important things for young researchers to do is to
"sell" their science so they can land a good position. This means that the own research is at the center of each presentation. This may be helpful for a job
interview, or specialized conferences. But in most cases, people are not interested
in your work, people are interested in the field and the work that is done in the
field in general. In most cases, the work of the researcher will not be relevant.
But the field might be, which means that we are missing out.

Story of the prof I introduced and put a picture of his family in the talk and
continued to say "noone care -- except him"
