Main assumption:
people are good.

- getting honest feedback is hard, and it gets harder if the direction of feedback is to come against the hierarchical chain

At the core of a good student-supervisor is a strong working relationship built on mutual trust.

- feedback I got: most problems had to do with communication, either
    - bad habits,
    - expectations were not clarified in the beginning
    - roles were not clarified
    - 'going dark' by supervision led to great stress (lack of communication)

This can lead to:
- anxiety & stress
- isolation
- self-harm
- self-sabotage
- suicidal thoughts
- and of course, a dramatic drop in productivity
- affect co-workers, again drop in productivity, prompt co-workers to leave

- people are different. But all have something to say. If someone does not say how they are doing, ask stuff => then its the supervisors job to make sure they are still heard. People who ask for help and give feedback may
     - know the environment and are confident in it
     - may have learnt (often by example) not to be afraid and shut up due to hierarchies     
     - feel confident in their role
    On the other hand, from my experience, people experiencing difficulties who do not ask for help/ let the supervisor know:
     - might have had detrimental previous experiences with previous workplaces
     - might be experiencing serious stress outside of the workplace (private, work-related)
     - might be intimidated by hierarchical structure or not feel confident in their role
     - Culture/ Where you are from does not matter. But: If new in an environment, this can (but does not need to) supercharge a few pre-existing conditions: anxiety, social stress, adverse experiences (eg racist incidents and attacks), lack of support network, super high expectations.  
  How to get through? This is difficult. Be there. Ask. Don't stop. When they need support, be there.
Why is it important?
  - Because they will feel
  - Because they will know things you don't know, or cannot know. Eg scientifically, about the project
  - This is the only relationship were you can give negative feedback and be heard, can expect a change/ an effect

- line of work (intellectual) of acute danger of isolation and cycle of high expectations and missed opportunities plus personality types prone to depression and lack of communication

- Building trust.

- You are the supervisor.

- Giving feedback oneself

- Where to start. => Go to their level (Lotta)

- When they are better than you

- Respect boundaries. But dont invent boundaries where there are none.

- Take consequences. Set boundaries. Make sure these boundaries are respected by the student, make sure you follow up on these boundaries. Dont shy away from conflict, follow up.

- the toughest decision by a supervisor: when to give freedom / laisser-faire, and when to look closer, ask. Note: This is not a decision based on the personality, but on the situation (that you will not fully know), and how well the student can deal with the situation at hand given his/ her prior experiences. The situation changes, so does.
