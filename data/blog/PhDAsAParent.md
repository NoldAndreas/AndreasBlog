Becoming a parent in academia often coincides with the early career phase and can feel [like stopping cycling halfway up a hill](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/10/when-it-comes-having-family-and-academic-career-find-what-works-you). New [studies](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/02/12/1810862116) highlight how important it is to take these challenges seriously: [More than a quarter](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/02/after-baby-28-new-parents-leave-full-time-stem-work) of new parents leave STEM employment. This disproportionally affects women’s careers: 43% of women leave vs 23% of men, and for women with kids, the [gender pay gap is much wider](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-10/the-pay-check-what-having-kids-does-to-women-s-pay), with huge implications for lifetime earnings. Pursing an academic career poses [additional challenges](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/07/for-female-scientists-theres-no-good-time-to-have-children/278165/).

Is there some secret for how to still make it all work? After all, it is difficult to have fun and connect with your child while near-drowning in the grind of daily responsibilities. This is where project management skills will come in handy, so I borrowed some ideas from strategic planner James Clear and applied them to parenting in science. The main idea is to approach parenting in a top-down level by first clarifying core beliefs, and then going to the more strategic and technical questions.  

### Why — Core beliefs

Having a child will invariably lead to some tough decisions. The “Why” stage is about clarifying your priorities and what is important to you and your family. What are you goals, what are you and your family willing to sacrifice and where are your red lines?

### What — Strategy

While there are many stories out there about apparent supermoms and dads who seem to make it all happen, the reality is that raising a child is highly vulnerable life stage, and that any family is dependent on a large [support network](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/17/academic-careers-work-life-balance) — emotionally, logistically and financially. Strategic decisions are about being aware of this proverbial village it takes to raise a child.

### How - Tactical

This level is about the day-to-day life hacks needed to make it all work. There is an abundance of books, newspaper articles and blogs that propose solutions at this level. I collected some resources below as a reference.
