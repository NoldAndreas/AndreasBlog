summary: The intricacies of becoming a parent during your PhD

Becoming a parent in academia often coincides with the early career phase and can feel [like stopping cycling halfway up a hill](like stopping cycling halfway up a hill). New [studies](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/02/12/1810862116) highlight how important it is to take these challenges seriously: [More than a quarter](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/02/after-baby-28-new-parents-leave-full-time-stem-work) of new parents leave STEM employment. This disproportionally affects women’s careers: 43% of women leave vs 23% of men, and for women with kids, the [gender pay gap is much wider](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-10/the-pay-check-what-having-kids-does-to-women-s-pay), with huge implications for lifetime earnings. Pursing an academic career poses [additional challenges](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/07/for-female-scientists-theres-no-good-time-to-have-children/278165/).

Is there some secret for how to still make it all work? While psychologists agree that seeing your child as your project is not a good idea, it is difficult to have fun and connect with your child while near-drowning in the grind of daily responsibilities. So after all, project management skills will come in handy (although not applied to your child). Here, we use ideas from strategic planning from James Clear for parenting (as a PhD):

### Why — Core beliefs

Having a child will invariably lead to some tough decisions. The “Why” stage is about clarifying your priorities and what is important to you and your family. What are you goals, what are you and your family willing to sacrifice and where are your red lines?

### What — Strategy

While there are many stories out there about apparent supermoms and dads who seem to make it all happen, the reality is that raising a child is highly vulnerable life stage, and that any family is dependent on a large [support network](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/aug/17/academic-careers-work-life-balance) — emotionally, logistically and financially. Strategic decisions are about being aware of this proverbial village it takes to raise a child.
