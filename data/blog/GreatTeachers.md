summary:  Teachers that inspired me
---

There are some teachers that had a great impact on what I then decided to learn. They also inspired me on how to think, or how to approach a topic. At the beginning of my PhD, I learnt some basics of statistical mechanics. The ease with which Leonard Susskind from Stanford introduced the subject fascinated me..

At some point later on, I wanted to revisit basics of dynamical systems. [Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos](http://www.stevenstrogatz.com/books/nonlinear-dynamics-and-chaos-with-applications-to-physics-biology-chemistry-and-engineering) is one of these books I really wished I had known during my undergraduate studies -- but luckily was not too late to enjoy the ease with which Steven Strogatz goes through phase transitions and complex systems.

Of course, in a list of awesome teachers, Andrew Ng with his courses on Machine Learning cannot be missing. I really believe his calm and humble style would make any subject appealing to learn.

Then as a non-native speaker, it was invaluable to be introduced to the rules of good writing by the classic [On Writing Well](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well) by William Zinsser. And finally -- maybe somehow offtopic -- there is this [newsletter/blog](https://www.brainpickings.org) by Marina Popova about which was a source of constant inspiration and book suggestions, and which recalibrated my senses after diving deep into a topic.

One thing these teachers and writers have in common is the effect they had: They might have been introducing a somewhat technical idea -- but ended up instilling a hunger to go far beyond and explore a new field.
