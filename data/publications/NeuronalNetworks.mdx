Relatively simple neuronal network configurations can give rise to surprisingly rich
repertoire of dynamic behaviours. For example, a stimulus can set off a cascade of
population spikes,

To ensure reliability and reproducibility of the C++ code used to compute these results, a user input is used, and a wide range of published results are reproduced. Some behaviors can also be reproduced using firing rate models, see also <TooltipCustom
