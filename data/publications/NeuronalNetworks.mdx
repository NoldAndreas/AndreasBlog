title: Neuronal Networks
---

Relatively simple neuronal network configurations can give rise to surprisingly rich
repertoire of dynamic behaviours. For example, a stimulus can set off a cascade of
population spikes, which may serve as a correlate for working memory.

Some behaviors can be explained using simpler firing rate models -- which can be described
by easily solvable differential equations:
