Relatively simple neuronal network configurations can give rise to surprisingly rich
repertoire of dynamic behaviours. For example, a stimulus can set off a cascade of <TooltipCustom

/>
<G0/>
Each population spike is driven by a specific synaptic dynamical behavior -- the availability of calcium, of neurotransmitter -- and the actual firing rate of the neuronal population:

Other mechanisms are for instance neuronal correlates of <TooltipCustom text_link="Bernáez Timón et al., 'Reconciling contrast invariance and non-linear computation in cortical circuits', BioRxiv" text_display="contrast invariance." href={"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.23.441165v1"}/> We have developed a C++ code which allows to explore the behavior of large neuronal networks in a systematic manner.
