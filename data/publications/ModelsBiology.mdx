 Working memory describes the brain's capacity to
 temporarily store a limited number of items. Its limited capacity sets it apart
 from stable long-term memory system. However, a computational models of working
 memory that represents memory through neuronal spikes and is finite in its duration
 is still missing.

 **Representation of items in the brain**

 

 As the background activity increases, a neural network traverses different states.
