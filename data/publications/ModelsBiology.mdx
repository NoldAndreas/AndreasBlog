# Representation of working memory items in the brain

Working memory describes the brain's capacity to temporarily store a limited number of items. Its limited capacity sets it apart from stable long-term memory system. There is one synaptic signaling pathway, which has implications for working memory performance, has been associated with shizophrenia -- and has been shown to interfer with a specific type of synaptic plasticity. We set up a simplified model of this pathway,

and included its effect in a <TooltipCustom

Glia are the cells which take care of neurons in the brain: For example, astrocytes provide nutrients, and microglia act as first responders in the case of neuronal injury. We set up a model which explores the limits of the balance between repair and dispose decisions of neuron-glia interactions.
Explore the behavior of the model with the code available on [Github](https://github.com/NoldAndreas/ResilienceFastAndSlow).
