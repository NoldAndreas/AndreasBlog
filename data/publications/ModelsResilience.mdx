/>, we explored possible failures in neuron-glia interactions prior to the onset of neurological diseases such as Multiple Sklerosis and Alzheimers.

Glia are the cells which take care of neurons in the brain: For example, astrocytes provide nutrients, and microglia act as first responders in the case of neuronal injury. We set up a model which explores the limits of the balance between repair and dispose decisions of neuron-glia interactions.
Explore the behavior of the model with the code available on [Github](https://github.com/NoldAndreas/ResilienceFastAndSlow).
