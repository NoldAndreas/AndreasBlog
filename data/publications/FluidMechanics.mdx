The moving contact line problem is one of the main unsolved fundamental problems in fluid mechanics, with relevant physical phenomena spanning multiple scales, from the molecular to the macroscopic scale.

At the mesoscale, a unified derivation for single and binary fluid diffuse interface models is presented, consolidating two models present in the literature. Results from an asymptotic analysis of the sharp interface limit of the binary fluid diffuse interface model are compared with numerical computations of the inner region in the vicinity of a moving contact line.



We want to understand the nanoscale structure of the density profile in the vicinity of the contact line. This is a hard problem, because of its small scale, large fluctuations and inhomogeneities. Typically, nanoscale properties are studied using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD resolves single particles, but needs to impose high contact line velocities, therefore requiring some other simplifying assumptions.

Here, we follow an alternative approach by using hydrodynamic dynamic density functional theory (HDDFT). It assumes that locally, the chemical $\mu$ potential is a functional of the fluid density profile,

$$
\mu = \frac{\delta \mathcal{F}}{\delta n} + V_{\textnormal{ext}}
$$

where $\mathcal{F}[n]$ is the free energy functional of the number density $n$ and $V_{\textnormal{ext}}$ is the external potential. The external potential models the force acting from the wall on the fluid particles. This formulation can then be employed in a momentum equation

$$
m n \frac{\textnormal{D{\bf v}}}{\textnormal{D}t} = - n {\boldsymbol \nabla}\left( \frac{\delta \mathcal{F}}{\delta n} \right) +
{\boldsymbol \nabla} \cdot {\boldsymbol \tau}
$$

This framework allows to study the interactions of particle interactions with hydrodynamic shear and compression forces $\boldsymbol \tau$.
This allows to see how a shear layer emerges close to the wall or where compression emerges
